MGTranslator
==========

Acrually MGTranslator , is used for online translation using translate.google.com

simply by using HTTP Request 

currently support 11 languages , any other can be used but you need to know its encoding 

first then you can add it to the code ..

I made this before a year when I was poor in programming so pardon me for bad coding :)

used for iOS and I did not try it for MAC OS .


there is a demo and it is self explanatory ,, the class you need to port to your code

is MGTranslator only  ...

Feel free to use ,modify ,publish and "whatever you want" the code !!
